In his new book, Pulitzer-prize winning author Klyde K. Kyleson details what he has dubbed the "Sigma grindset" or the "boy boss" lifestyle. We had the chance to sit down with him to discuss his latest project.

Kyleson describes his book:

“Well, first of all, it's not a book. It’s only bound to physical form through the necessity of written language in communication, but otherwise it is ephemeral and uncontainable. Anyways. This work breaks down the processes and proceedings of the male mind, the things that make it tick and the things that trigger a release of dopamine or serotonin or any other chemical within the male brain. The culture is rich and deserves exploration and understanding, it begs to be uncovered and unwrapped with care and delicacy. The male mind is stronger and firmer than any substance known to man, including diamonds and even graphene, which is a near molecular substance that science is not even close to fully understanding. Within the mind of the man, there are secrets to life that must be declared publicly, because living this way is achievable by all, but only the strongest will truly accomplish peak male mentality.”

“One night I was on Triple C’s clinging onto the bathroom walls at Earls, and some Joe Schmoe in the small urinal asked me if I was okay. This convinced me that everyone wanted to be just like me, so I created something to be used as a lifestyle guide.”

“When I’m getting drizzy on a tizzy, I need my boys around me. No hoes, no broads, no slags, nary a wench in sight; just the boys. It's a sacred time for us—that's communion.”  

During the interview, Kyleson reminisces over middle-of-the-bar huddles, vaguely homoerotic rituals (“we’re all rock-fucking-hard”). 

When asked about female influences in his life, Kyleson says that he aims to make contact with “as few women as [he] can possibly muster.” He explains that such avoidance is part of the “sigma grindset,” a philosophy that glorifies a man’s solidarity and stoicism.
“I want to be a good role model for these boys. No witchery or bitchery [sic] up in this business; I haven’t spoken to my mother in years [“huffing with angry face” emoji].”
	
“If I’m out on the prowl, you know I’m about to get Slick-Schnasty Slaughterdaled [sic]. Absolutely snausaged to the tits.”

Kyleson garnered editorial props for his use of real, boots-on-the-ground reporting and quotes from other Sigma males. The Fishwrapper had the opportunity to speak with Kyleson’s fraternity brother, Carson Karsten, a featured interviewee, about his experiences within the frat and as a practitioner of the ASS lifestyle.  

“What does a typical Tuesday look like for me? Beer in my right hand, boys around me, dick in a peanut butter jar, Elfbar in my left hand. We hit up Earl’s, we eat some Pauly’s, we do some [redacted] in the [redacted] with [redacted], I punch a lamppost, lights out by 4.”
